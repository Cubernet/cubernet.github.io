<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an associate research fellow in Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP). I got my Ph.D degree in December 2019 from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/)). I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaosong Zhang](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/info/1035/13033.htm) and Prof. Qingxin Zhu. From September 2018 to September 2019, I was a visiting student at UC Santa Barbara. I am open to collaboration and communication. If you want to share awesome ideas, feel free to contact me.

I am interested in the security of software and algorithms. While I also work on many other projects, my current research focus is the security of artificial intelligence, which broadly involves research on attack and defense for AI algorithms, explainable AI (XAI), data privacy protection, LLM security, etc. I have published over 40 papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2ahbtVoAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

My research team has multiple openings for <span style="color:red">Research Associate/Assistant Professors, Research/Software Engineers, Research Assistants, Research Interns<span style="color:red">, please drop me an email or visit the website of [CAEP graduate school](https://zsxx.gscaep.ac.cn/list/13) for more information.
